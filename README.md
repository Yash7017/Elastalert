# Elastalert
Setting up Elastalert to raise alert for patterns and keywords. While we want to setup up alerts for increasing a particular patterns or keywords in the file. then we use the elastalert and postfix as SMTP server. 

**To be noted** : Here we are raising alerts and sending them to Email only. i will attach more links to raise the alert for other platforms also like jira or slack. if you need any of them please visit them.
